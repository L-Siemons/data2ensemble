Data2ensembles is a module for calculating NMR proptertines from Molecular dynamics simulations 
and analysing relaxation experiments. This module is intended for my own use and it heavily under
development. You are welcome to use it but please be aware it is at your own risk - many functions 
have not been 'finished' and so might not give the correct outputs. 

If you publish anything using this work please contact me.
